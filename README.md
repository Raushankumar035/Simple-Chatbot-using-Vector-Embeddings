# Simple-Chatbot-using-Vector-Embeddings

Vector embeddings transform text into numerical representations that capture the meaning and context, enabling the system to find related information even if the exact words differ. By storing these embeddings in a vector database, the assistant can perform fast and meaningful semantic searches, allowing it to maintain context and provide smarter, more relevant responses over time. Let's build a simple chatbot that gives results to the user queries, stores them in a vector database and can be used for future references.
